<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required</span>


Under the `signing` config option the signatures are configured.

## `alg`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">enum</span>
<span class="badge badge-blue" title="Default Value">ES512</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>

The signing algorithm that is used.

Supported values are:

- `ES256`
- `ES384`
- `ES512`
- `EdDSA` (ed25519)
- `RS256`
- `RS384`
- `RS512`
- `PS256`
- `PS384`
- `PS512`

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    signing:
        alg: EdDSA
    ```


## `rsa_key_len`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">integer</span>
<span class="badge badge-blue" title="Default Value">2048</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>

The `rsa_key_len` option defines the length of the generated key, if an 
RSA-based signing key is used and the key is generated by LightHouse because 
it was not provided externally.


??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    signing:
        alg: PS256
        rsa_key_len: 4096
    ```

## `key_file`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">file path</span>
<span class="badge badge-orange" title="If this option is required or optional">required unless `key_dir` is given</span>

The `key_file` option specifies the path to the file that contains the 
private signing key. The public key does not need to be provided; LightHouse 
will derive it from the private key.

If the key file does exist, LightHouse will use the provided signing key. If 
the key file does not exist yet, LightHouse generates a new private key 
according to the specified parameters (e.g. [`alg`](#alg)).

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    signing:
        key_file: /path/to/signing.key
    ```

## `key_dir`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">directory path</span>
<span class="badge badge-orange" title="If this option is required or optional">required*</span>

!!! warning ":fontawesome-solid-person-digging: Not Yet Implemented"

    This option is not yet implemented! Currently only `key_file` is supported.

The `key_dir` option specifies the path to a directory that contains the
private signing key(s).
If automatic key rollover is enabled (a feature coming in the future), a key 
dir must be used instead of a key file.
??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    signing:
        key_dir: /path/to/keys
    ```
